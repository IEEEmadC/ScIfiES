Today online market places like ebay,amazon..etc, which facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through their websites have taken a prominent place of people’s lives due to their busy schedules. And this method of buying and selling has become so easy to both buyer and seller.

So, we thought to make this process a lot easier to the customer by creating an app as lives are becoming more and more complicated.

As vast majority of people already use both mobile apps and online shopping market, combining these two together will surely be a huge advantage.

What will our amazing app does?? Simply, Our aim is to create the app in a way that it finds any product from online market by scanning an image of the needed product.The scanned image will be identified by the app and then it searches for the availability of that item in online marketplaces.After that, the app let the customer to choose the online market that he or she would prefer to buy it.It shows not only foreign online market places but also local online market places.Then the customer will be directed to their preferred online market.Boom!!! That would be awesome!

Some times there may be products that we need to buy, but we don't know it’s name or we may have forgotten the name of that product. Problem solved!!!!Our app helps you in case of such instances. After scanning the product, it will be identified by the app. Photo scanning is a special feature offered by our app.

Usually, most of the online market places have apps for each. It is a waste of space.This number of apps can be reduced by using our app since it allow access to all those market’s websites.

How did we carry out this?
First we thought of a problem faced by people nowadays.Then we came up with this idea and decided with the features which the app should have, like providing the customer with tangible benifits including reducing cost, saving time etc.Then we thought about the targeted users for the app since it is very important and it may lead to enhance the success ratio of the app.Then what we thought was the mobile applications and the devices to be supported by the app.We used Android Studio platform in developing our app.Out of the major programming languages that are largely used for mobile app development, we used java which the official language for Android development. It is easy to handle this language and many open source libraries are made available for users to choose from.

Absolutely,this would be an incredible experience for the online buyers.
